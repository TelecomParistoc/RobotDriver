/*
 * Motor driver : provides high level access to the robot's main motors
 * through the I2C bus.
 * functionnalities provided :
 *  > read and write the distance travelled by each wheel
 *    (quantum is ~1.5 mm)
 *  > read the actual speed and write the target speed (which will be PID
 *    controlled)
 *  > read/write PID coefficients
 *  > get/set heading of the robot
 *  Note : in order to free the programmer from I2C ressource sharing
 * considerations, read may be cached and write may be delayed when write/read
 * are made too often and might saturate the I2C bus.
 * See setMotorDriverUpdateFreq() for more details.

 *  + for read : if there is any data fresher than 1/max_freq, return data

 *  + for write : if any transaction has been sent in the last 1/max_freq period,
 *    delay write */
